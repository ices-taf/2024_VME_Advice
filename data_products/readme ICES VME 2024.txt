Data product: EU request on areas where Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) are known to occur or are likely to occur in EU waters. 

The data in this folder accompany the 2024 ICES advice on areas where VMEs are known to occur or are likely to occur in EU waters (https://doi.org/XXXX).

The data should be interpreted and used in conjunction with the main advice document (https://doi.org/XXXX) and the interactive document (https://doi.org/XXXX). The main advice document provides definitions and describes input data, methods of analysis, and interpretation.

The recommended citation for the data product is:

The data product comprises:

PDF maps showing the locations of clipped VME polygons as created following application of scenarios A, B, C, D, and E, the assesment areas, and the 400â€“800 m depth zone as evaluated at the c-square scale. Maps include the VME polygon ID number. The clipping process may split a single overlapping polygon with a unique numeric identifier into two or more clipped polygons. In this case, the VME polygon ID number includes an additional character identifier (a, b, c....).

Data files providing the spatial coordinates of clipped VME polygons in .csv and .xlsx formats, as created following application of scenarios A, B, C, D, and E. Column headers for these files are described in Annex 2 of the main advice document. Coordinates are provided in decimal degrees, rounded to 3 digits, following the WGS84 projection (epsg: 4326).

Shapefiles (.shx, .shp, .prj, .dbf) for the clipped VME polygons, as created following application of scenarios A, B, C, D, and E. The 'id' column in the .shp files corresponds to the 'Polygon_Number' in the .csv and .xlsx files (Annex 2, main advice document). Shapefiles have the WGS84 projection (epsg: 4326).
